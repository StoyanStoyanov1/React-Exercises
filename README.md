Here I practice and develop my React skills, focusing on functional and asynchronous programming, organized in a logical way. Tasks include creating authentication providers, implementing user registration, login, and logout, as well as handling errors with ErrorBoundary. I also develop various features where only the user who created them can modify them in some way. Additionally, I implement functionalities for commenting and liking.
